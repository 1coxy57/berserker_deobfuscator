Berserker Deobfuscator
Berserker is a Python-based deobfuscator designed to reverse obfuscated code and help developers understand and debug obfuscated scripts. This tool is primarily aimed at analyzing obfuscated JavaScript or similar languages, making it easier to inspect and comprehend the underlying logic.

Features
Deobfuscation: Convert obfuscated code back to a more readable and understandable form.
Supports Asynchronous Operations: Optimized for handling large scripts with async functions.
Flexible Input: Accepts files as input to deobfuscate from disk.
Installation
To get started with Berserker, you'll need Python 3.7 or higher.

Step 1: Clone the repository
You can clone the repository directly from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/berserker.git
cd berserker
Step 2: Install dependencies
Berserker uses asyncio for asynchronous tasks, and you may have additional dependencies in the requirements.txt file (if any). To install them, run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don’t have any dependencies listed, you can skip this step.

Usage
Once you’ve installed Berserker, you can use it via the command line.

Command-Line Interface (CLI)
Berserker can be run from the command line using the python command. Here's the syntax:

bash
Copy code
python deobfuscate.py <file_path>
Arguments
file_path (required): The path to the file you want to deobfuscate. This can be any file containing obfuscated code that Berserker is designed to handle.
Example Usage
bash
Copy code
python deobfuscate.py /path/to/obfuscated_code.txt
This will read the file located at /path/to/obfuscated_code.txt, deobfuscate its contents, and print the result to the terminal.

Example Output
After running the tool, you’ll see the deobfuscated content printed to the terminal. Here’s an example of what you might see:

javascript
Copy code
Original Obfuscated Code:
    var _0x57f7 = 'someObfuscatedString';
    var _0x482f = function(x) { return x+10; }
    
Deobfuscated Output:
    var username = 'user123';
    var addTen = function(x) { return x + 10; }
The tool will attempt to translate the obfuscated code back into a more readable form. The complexity of deobfuscation depends on how the code was obfuscated initially.

Notes
Berserker is best suited for deobfuscating scripts that have been obfuscated using certain techniques (e.g., variable name mangling, string encoding). The effectiveness of deobfuscation depends on the obfuscation method used.
This tool is intended for educational purposes and is not meant for illegal activities. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before deobfuscating any code.
